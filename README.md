* ## Install üöÄStarship
  1. Go to [starship github](https://github.com/starship/starship/releases). Under **Assets** of the latest release, click on *Show all assets*. Download the one suitable for your system.  
  Alternatively, you can install it using any package package manager like [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install), [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/) etc.

  2. Check if starship installed correctly by typing `starship` in terminal powershell. You should see some usage and commands related to starship.
  3. Go to your home folder by running this `cd ~` command in powershell.Now run `nodepad $profile`. A file will open in nodepad. Paste this line in it and save.

      ```
      pip install pywal colorthief colorz haishoku
      ```

* ## ‚öôÔ∏èConfiguration
  1. Go to home directory by running `mkdir ~\.config`.
  You may enconter something like  
  *'An item with the specified name C:\Users\Utkarsh\.config already exists.'*  
  Its just saying the folder already exists. So, you can ignore and continue.

  2. Now run `cd ~\.config` and then type `explorer .` and hit enter.This will open a **.config** folder.
  3. Download and paste the files form .config folder of this repo to your .config folder.
  4. Finally, run `cd ~`. Then type `notepad $profile` and hit enter. Copy and paste all code from *Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1* file of this repo to you *$profile* file opened with notepad, save and exit.

* ## üíªPersonalize
  1. Use this as an starting point and personalise your terminal as you like.
  
  2. make changes to `~\.config\starship.toml` for customization of starship.
  Checkout [here](https://starship.rs/config/) for starship configuration.

  3. Run `wal --theme random` to generate a random color palette. Then run `Update-WalTheme` to update terminal with this palette.
  
  4. You can also use an image to get color palette and update terminal color scheme. Use this command:
      ``` powershell
      Update-WalTheme -Image .\path\to\new\background.jpg
      ```
      Remember this will also change desktop background to this image.
